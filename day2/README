========================================= DAY 2 ===============================

part 1

- created a brute force approach to iterate through the given ranges and add invalid ids together.
- main takes care of file i/o, adding ranges to a string vector.
- checkIds goes through the string vector and manually runs through each range in a for loop. all invalids are added
	to a uint64 vector.
- sumVect pulls values from vector and adds them up to return.
- main prints total invalid ids and exits.

notes
- I struggled with this due to some conversion misery. I left old code but essentially the char* -> uint couldn't 
	handle a few values.
- There's definitely a better way than to brute force this. Optimization could be to just use math (look over low end,
	and high end range. just compare values across that full spectrum).
- Definitely want to use another option for part 2. Regex? (I could use some practice with them).

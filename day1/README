========== STAR 1 ==========

Created a simple main/decode function to parse the input and get the count at 0.

main
- Handles file i/o
- calls decode per line of the file input
- output final count of all 0s when turning dial

decode
- turns dial given direction
- resets dial if we reach one of the bounds
- adds counted 0s to the current count in main


========== STAR 2 ==========
Originally I had this as my first solution, I had placed my count increase at the end of each iteration of decode's loop.


Thoughts:
Using a global to keep count isn't the best idea, there's better ways to manage this value when running decode.
Potential idea to use a wrapper function that only returns the completed count, but we'd need to be more creative.
Using a vector<str,int> might be smart instead of completing the function within the file input stream.

Created a simple main/decode function to parse the input and get the count at 0.

main
- Handles file i/o
- calls decode per line of the file input
- output final count of all 0s when turning dial

decode
- turns dial given direction
- resets dial if we reach one of the bounds
- adds counted 0s to the current count in main

Thoughts:

Room to avoid using a global to keep count, sort of a band-aid fix so to speak.
Potential idea to use a wrapper function that only returns the completed count, but we'd need to be more creative.
Potential to use a vector that holds a tuple (str, int). insert lines into vector that we can use in wrapper function.
